## üìÑ Project Overview

This repository implements a full pipeline for analyzing fan conversations on OnlyFans. The solution includes segmentation, feature extraction, profiling, embedding, clustering, and visualization ‚Äî all containerized with Docker for reproducibility.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ **Conversation segmentation**: Automatically segment conversations into stages based on purchasing milestones (Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3).
- ‚úÖ **Feature extraction**: Compute per-conversation metrics such as message count, revenue, purchase rate, duration, and churn risk signals.
- ‚úÖ **Fan profiling (LLM-based)**: Extract fan demographics, life events, emotional needs, and purchasing motivations using OpenAI.
- ‚úÖ **Embeddings**: Create high-quality text embeddings using VoyageAI, with optional hybrid embeddings that include fan profile features.
- ‚úÖ **Clustering**: Segment fans into behavior-based clusters using KMeans and analyze engagement patterns.
- ‚úÖ **Visualization**: Generate 2D UMAP and interactive 3D cluster plots to understand fan segments visually.
- ‚úÖ **Caching and batching**: Cache LLM responses to reduce costs and batch process conversations for API efficiency.
- ‚úÖ **Docker support**: Easily run the entire pipeline using Docker Compose.

- These fans exhibit high spend or long-term retention potential.
- Personalized emotional engagement drives higher conversion.

**Action**:
- Assign experienced chatters to these fans.
- Create premium content packages and emotional engagement scripts.

---

### 2. **Nudge Drifters into Action**
**Cluster 1 ("The Drifters")** represents the largest segment but low monetization. With targeted nudges, a portion can be converted.

**Action**:
- Use limited-time offers.
- Apply FOMO-based messaging scripts.
- Monitor for engagement windows.

---

### 3. **Deprioritize Ghosts, Focus on Early Hook**
**Cluster 4 ("The Ghosts")** shows negligible return after 3 days of inactivity.

**Action**:
- Focus first 24‚Äì48 hours with bold, emotionally compelling outreach.
- If unresponsive after 3 days, reduce contact frequency.

---

### 4. **Integrate Fan Profiling in Real-Time**
Fan profile-enriched embeddings (Method B) outperform pure message embeddings.

**Action**:
- Integrate real-time fan profiling during live conversations.
- Enrich chat dashboards with personality and background tags.

---

### 5. **Revamp Chatter Training**
Train chatters on cluster-specific behaviors and stage-based tactics (acquisition, monetization, retention).

**Action**:
- Refresh training materials every 90 days.
- Use cluster-based simulation for new chatter onboarding.

---

## Financial Impact Estimate (Based on Current Data)

- **Revenue uplift potential**: +15‚Äì25% from targeting high-value clusters
- **Churn reduction**: -20% among "Romantics" and "Whales"
- **Cost savings**: More efficient chatter time allocation

# Cluster Analysis Report

## Overview

This document summarizes the clustering outcomes of fan-model interactions across three conversation stages, using two embedding strategies:

- **Method A**: Conversation-only embeddings
- **Method B**: Conversation embeddings augmented with fan profiling features

Both methods applied UMAP for dimensionality reduction and k-means clustering, followed by visualization in 2D and 3D. Clustering was executed per stage to reflect behavioral progression.

---

## Clustering Methodology

### Embedding Strategies

- **Method A**: Text-only UMAP embeddings from each fan-model-stage triplet
- **Method B**: Combined embeddings of UMAP + fan profile vectors (e.g., job, emotional traits)

### Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering

- UMAP (n_components=2 and 3)
- K-means clustering
- Cluster count: k = 5 (chosen based on elbow method and silhouette score)

---

## Visualization Outputs

- **2D UMAP Plots**:
  - `cluster_umap_method_A.png`
  - `cluster_umap_method_B.png`

- **3D Interactive Plots**:
  - `cluster_3d_method_A.html`
  - `cluster_3d_method_B.html`

These visualizations are included in the `visualizations/` directory.

---

## Method A: Key Observations

### Visual Structure

- Distinct clusters with moderate separation
- Clusters correspond to different fan behaviors (e.g., length, engagement, purchase frequency)

### Cluster Interpretation

| Cluster | Behavior Pattern                          | Notable Metrics                      |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0       | High retention, multiple purchases        | High revenue, long duration          |
| 1       | Low activity fans                         | Short sessions, minimal engagement   |
| 2       | New fans, no purchases yet                | Only Stage 1 data                    |
| 3       | Explorers, many messages but no buys      | High engagement, low conversion      |
| 4       | Churned early                             | Short-lived, no return behavior      |

---

## Method B: Key Observations

### Visual Structure

- Tighter clustering around fan traits
- One dominant cluster suggests profiling data compressed variance
- Better separation of high vs low-value users

### Cluster Interpretation

| Cluster | Description                               | Fan Traits                   |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 0       | Premium fans                               | High spend, emotional sharing|
| 1       | Default cluster (dominated most users)     | Mixed traits, lower variance |
| 2       | Romantic, emotionally attached             | Regular, deep interactions   |
| 3       | Surface-level chatters                     | Transactional conversations  |
| 4       | Lonely fans looking for attention          | Sensitive keywords, clingy   |

---

## Comparison: Method A vs Method B

| Aspect                  | Method A                         | Method B                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Cluster Separation      | Moderate                         | Higher with enriched features             |
| Behavioral Insight      | Pure text patterns               | Profile-based segmentation possible       |
| Actionability           | Medium                           | High ‚Äì clusters align with known personas |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Adopt Method B** for production segmentation due to richer, actionable clusters.
2. **Use Method A** when profile data is unavailable or incomplete.
3. **Incorporate profiles in real-time** to personalize chatter strategies.

---
